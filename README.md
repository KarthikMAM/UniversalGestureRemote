# UniversalGestureRemote

This is an application which I developed for the <b>32 HOUR STARTUP</b> challenge held in my college as a prototype. It is used to interface
my computer to an arduino device which uses <b>GYROSCOPE</b> to send me with the current tilt. Using this data I can recognize gestures.
Then I use scripts which I have written to <b>CONTROL OTHER APPLICATIONS</b> like 
<ul>
  <li>Media players
  <li>Text editors
  <li>Presentations
  <li>Volume
  <li>Start menu
  <li>and a lot of other applications are to be added in the future
</ul>

This application also uses the prototype library that was developed by me in the <b>32 HOUR STARTUP CHALLENGE</b>.
