# UniversalGestureRemote

This is an application which I developed for the <b>32 HOUR STARTUP</b> challenge held in my college as a prototype. It is used to interface my computer to an arduino device which uses <b>GYROSCOPE</b> to send me with the current tilt. Using this data I can recognize gestures. Then I use scripts which I have written to <b>CONTROL OTHER APPLICATIONS</b> like 
<ul>
  <li>Media players
  <li>Text editors
  <li>Web Browsers
  <li>Presentations
  <li>Volume
  <li>Start menu
  <li>and the <b>POSSIBILITES ARE ENDLESS</b>
</ul>

Here are a few sample videos taken during the course of the competition. Each of these videos shows how different applications were controlled using <b>GESTURES</b>

This application uses the prototype library that was developed by me in the <b>32 HOUR STARTUP CHALLENGE</b>. 
The demo and the library are implemented using c# and the project is a simple and easy to understand console application. Here is a link to the <a href="https://github.com/KarthikMAM/GestureRecognition"><b>DEMO</b></a> project. This project infact is the core of the gesture-recognition software and was the first <b>WORKING PROTOTYPE</b> I built for this system.
